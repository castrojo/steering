# Kubernetes Contributor Travel Fund

## Purpose

To establish and administer a fund for members of the Kubernetes upstream contributor community to travel and particiate in KubeCon/CloudNativeCon.

## Requirements

 - Candidates must be a [member of the Kubernetes GitHub organization][membership] or working towards it. Exceptions may be granted at the discretion of the steering committee. 
 - Those requesting funds must indicate that they do not have funding available from another source, such as an employer or the event itself that might cover costs for presenters.
 - Candidates may request partial funding for a specific purpose, for example "hotel only" or some other part of a trip. 

## Process

Requests must be made at least three months before the event. For large events the travel fund coordinators may set a deadline ahead off time for requests. Requests submitted after that will not be approved.

It is strongly recommended that you submit your request far enough in advance to get approval before making relevant expenditures.
Review of requests will take at least 72 hours and may take considerably longer. Note, with limited funds available, approval is not guaranteed.

### Visa Tips

For all events, it is recommended to apply for a visa at least 6 months prior.

### Requesting Travel Funds

Fill out a request in the TODO: travel form. 
Your application will only be visible to TODO: $certain_group due to privacy.
        
You'll be asked:
 - Your Name
 - The name of the event you plan to attend.
 - The location, dates of the event and where you will be traveling from.
 - The presentation you intend to give, if applicable.
 - The size of the stipend you wish to receive.
   - The stipend could be used for meals, travel expenses, and other conference-related expenses. It should NOT be used as personal spending money. 

### Approval

A request is approved when all of the following criteria are met:

- The request has approval from at least two members of the TODO:$certain_group
- No members of TODO: $certain_group objected to the request.
- The issue has been closed.

An appointed treasurer from the TODO: $certain_group will liaise with a member of CNCF on a regular basis to review the status of the travel fund. 
In the event that any pending requests might not be approved because of available funds, a separate issue will be raised. 
Generally speaking, however, members shouldn't need to worry about the status of the fund itself.

### Considerations for approval of a request

If there are too many requests for the limited funds, we will measure the following:

#### Impact

Preference is given to speakers, panelists, and those volunteering onsite at the conference.
How much you contribute to the project.

#### Outreach

Preference is given to underserved communities.

#### Cost

The larger the stipend the more critically the travel fund admins will consider the request and application.
The budget for this program is a finite resource.

#### Equity

Preference is given to individuals who cannot receive travel funding from their employers or individuals who have not previously received a stipend.

### Social Post

After the trip, participants are encouraged to write up a blog post or use similar social media to share their experiences with the community. This step is optional.
